At each screen edge, walls must line up (if there is a wall on one side, there
must be a wall on the other side). Defer to existing Legend of Zelda map for
specifics on which walls fit.

Biomes must be preserved.
	Lakes must be contiguous/docks must line up
	Coast must be along the map edge
	Graveyard must be clustered
	Mountain must be long and narrow
	Transition areas should exist
	Sub-areas should exist, too.
	River must be contiguous/have a waterfall

Lost Hills/forest must be dealt with
	Hopefully figure out how to move them [done]
	Figure out how to change the codes and provide hints for them [mostly
done]
	If cannot move them, work around their existence [know how to do]

There must be enough cave entrances
	Be able to require a certain number of "dungeon entrances"
	Be able to guarantee a certain number of "open caves" that can be accessed
without any additional items

Problems:
Deal with graphical glitches? [Currently cannot find one of them; other is
understood and should be fine]
Certain screens are repeats in the original rom.
