//At the start of the file are four ints:
mapwidth mapheight screenwidth screenheight
//mapwidth is the width of the map in screens; similarly for mapheight
//screenwidth is the width of the screen in tiles; similarly for screenheight

//After this opening, the data for each screen is presented in order from left
//to right, top to bottom.
//First, the two palettes for the screen (outer and inner). The
//available palettes are "brown" "green" and "gray"; at some point "orange"
//may be available
//Immediately after the palettes comes info for any special screen entrance
//that isn't coded directly into the tiles. The two options supported are
//"recorder" (which adds a staircase to the spot a whistle spot would be)
//and a coordinate pair (which draws a red square around the tile indicated
//by the coordinates, intended to be used for armos caves).
//If neither is in the screen, put any single word that is not a number or
//"recorder" there; I use "null" as my word of choice.
//So, forms of specialentrance: "recorder", 
								xCoord yCoord (like "3 2")
								"null"
outerpalette innerpalette specialentrance
//After the palettes come the IDs for each tile in order from left to right,
//top to bottom.
ID ID ID ID
ID ID ID ID
//The number of screens and the number of tiles are determined by the widths
//and heights presented at the start of the file.
//Line breaks are optional but can help readability; the example file
//linebreaks at the start of each screen, after the palette info, and at the
//end of each line.


//So, here's how it looks together:
mapwidth mapheight screenwidth screenheight
outerpalette innerpalette specialentrance
ID ID ID ID ID ID ID ID
ID ID ID ID ID ID ID ID
ID ID ID ID ID ID ID ID
outerpalette innerpalette specialentrance
ID ID ID ID ID ID ID ID

//etc.
